# Understanding Drug Use: Insights and Key Factors of Drug Behaviour 

## Abstract
In the report, we utilize a dataset containing measures of different personality traits and frequency alongside use frequencies of multiple drugs for 1885 participants. We found that not only are there distinct differences between users and non-users of drugs, but also significant differences with the drug user category. Models were constructed to determine the relationship between each personality trait and a particular drug use risk behaviour, with differences being inferred using model outputs.

## Introduction
Drug abuse has consistently been a problem in society regardless of region and time period, with the global drug situation constantly increasing in severity and complexity1 e.g. the ongoing Opioid epidemic in the US. Current methods of prevention set by global policymakers largely revolve around the prohibition of these substances which was heavily influenced by President Nixon during his War on Drugs campaign. However, as we can now see, this global undertaking was not only a massive failure in preventing drug abuse domestically -contributing to the increased rate of drug overdoses and drug-related illness-, but also helped nurtured and sustained powerful drug cartels and criminal organizations across the world2.

To develop better drug policies, a foundational understanding of why people abuse drugs must be established. This report will attempt to characterize and understand the underlying psychological relationships that influence drug behaviours using different personality trait measures.
